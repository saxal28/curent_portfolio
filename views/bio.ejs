            <h3>About Me</h3>
               <p class="paragraph-text">Hi There! I'm Alan: a developer with a passion for learning, creating, and building. Oddly enough, I didn't go to school for web development. I actually came across programming and web development unintentionally. However, I fell in love with it immediately. To me, development is the ultimate form of creative freedom.

I have enjoyed every step of my learning journey and can't wait for the future in this budding industry. </p>
